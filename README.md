Refactor assignment - week 1 homework

Edited HTML code to be compatible with screen readers by changing div elemnts to semantic friendly elemments such as section, aside, header, footer, article, etc. Added alt descriptions for all images. Also, added additional spacing to make code easier to read and flow better.

Updated CSS code to reflect changes made in the HTML document regarding renamed elements and thier selectors. Also reorganized the CSS code to mirror the flow with the HTML document so it is easier to decipher, and added comments to each section.
